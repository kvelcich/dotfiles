# Dotfiles
This project automates the setup process for all of my dotfiles and 
configurations.

## Installation

To install run the following command:
```sh
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kvelcich/dotfiles/master/install.sh`"
```

This will install the dotfiles, plugins, and configurations for:
  * [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
  * [Z shell (zsh)](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)
  * [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)

### Supported Operating Systems

As far as I'm aware this should work for all distrobutions of Linux as well as
macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 

As the configurations grow and automation becomes more complex, the 
compatability may become less stable. Currently this has been tested on the 
following systems:
  * [Arch WSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL)
  * [macOS Mojave](https://www.apple.com/macos/mojave/)
